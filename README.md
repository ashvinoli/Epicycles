# Epicycles
Draw your sketchs with epicycle now. Few images are provided as examples. You may provide any png. This is a very crude version of drawing with epicycles. Further refinements will be done in future.
## Usage
Simply provide the name of png file to the program.
Install required libraries. If there is version issue, open the requirements file and remove the versions. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the program by supplying the name of png.
```
python draw_with_epicycles.py ashvin.png
```
