# Epicycles
Draw your outer contour of images with epicycle now. For now the alphabet "A" and pi symbol are already provided. You may provide any png. This is a very crude version of drawing with epicycles. Further refinements will be done in future.
## Usage
Simply provide the name of png file to the program.
Install libraries like pygame, numpy, cv2, by pip install then,
```
python draw_with_epicycles.py a.png
```
